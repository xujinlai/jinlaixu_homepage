title = "Resilient stream processing in edge computing"
abstract = "The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devicesis  rapidly  increasing  the  demands  for  efficient  processing  oflow  latency  stream  data  generated  close  to  the  edge  of  thenetwork. A large number of IoT applications require continuousprocessing of data streams in real-time. Examples include virtualreality  applications,  connected  autonomous  vehicles  and  smartcity applications. Although current distributed stream processingsystems offer various forms of fault tolerance, existing schemes donot understand the dynamic characteristics of edge computing in-frastructures and the unique requirements of edge computing ap-plications. Optimizing fault tolerance techniques to meet latencyrequirements while minimizing resource usage becomes a criticaldimension  of  resource  allocation  and  scheduling  when  dealingwith latency-sensitive IoT applications in edge computing. In thispaper, we present a novel resilient stream processing frameworkthat   achieves   system-wide   fault   tolerance   while   meeting   thelatency  requirements  for  edge-based  applications.  The  proposedapproach  employs  a  novel  resilient  physical  plan  generation  forstream  queries  and  optimizes  the  placement  of  operators  tominimize  the  processing  latency  during  recovery  and  reducesthe overhead of checkpointing. We implement a prototype of theproposed  techniques  in  Apache  Storm  and  evaluate  it  in  a  realtestbed.  Our  results  demonstrate  that  the  proposed  approach  ishighly effective and scalable while ensuring low latency and low-cost  recovery  for  edge-based  stream  processing  applications."
