## Overview

The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is rapidly increasing the demands for efficient processing of low latency stream data generated close to the edge of the network. Edge computing-based stream processing techniques that carefully consider the heterogeneity of the computational and network resources available in the infrastructure provide significant benefits in optimizing the throughput and end-to-end latency of the data streams.
