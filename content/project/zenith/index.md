## Overview

In the Internet of Things(IoT) era, the demands for low-latency computing for time-sensitive applications (e.g., location-based augmented reality games, real-time smart grid management, real-time navigation using wearables) has been growing rapidly. Edge Computing provides an additional layer of infrastructure to fill latency gaps between IoT devices and the backend computing infrastructure.

*Zenith* decouples **resource allocation** and **service provisioning and management** at the edge and provides a novel model to allocate resources at the edge to maximize utility. Zenith aims at increasing the overall resource allocation efficiency by allowing resources to be allocated and shared in a latency-aware manner. 

## What is the challenge?
 + Fair and Efficient Resource Allocation across Geographically Distributed Edge Resources
 + Fast Service Discovery on Highly Distributed Micro Data Centers

## How Zenith Works?
 + Geographic Division usingWeighted Vonoroi Diagram (WVD)
    + Service Discovery with Constant Time
    + Naturally Satisfies Latency-Sensitive Workloads with Nearest Service Discovery
    + Dynamically Balances the Workloads Between Micro Data Centers
    + Easy and Fast to Update
 + Auction-based Resource Allocation
    + Truthfulness: No Incentives for Cheating. 
    + Budget Balance: Keeps the Allocation Process more Sustainable
    + Naturally Finds the Equilibrium Between Supply and Demand
 + Resource Sharing Contracts
    + Longer duration of Contracts Avoid Frequent Migrations
    + Stable Running Environment Suits the Requirements for Latency-Sensitive Workloads
